# Success Life Metrics Collider
_Where human performance meets quantum precision._

![Collider Energy](https://img.shields.io/badge/collider--energy-calibrating-lightgrey)

## What is This?
This is our **real-time human data collider** — a living experiment tracking the fusion of:
- Physical training metrics
- Mental performance markers
- Social output impact
- Creative/technical throughput

Every entry in `metrics.csv` is a **particle event** in our universe.  
Our goal: **observe, measure, and optimize human potential like a particle accelerator measures collisions.**

## Data Model
The collider logs:
- **Date**
- **Metric type**
- **Raw value**
- **Energy equivalence (GeV)** — calculated from weighted performance formulas

## Vision
The same way CERN smashes protons to find truth in the fabric of reality,  
we smash our **daily inputs, outputs, and patterns** to find what builds the **highest sustained state**.

> _We’re not chasing motivation — we’re building a machine that doesn’t need it._

## Roadmap
- [ ] Automate live collider badge from `metrics.csv`
- [ ] Intensity-based color system for badge (green → yellow → red)
- [ ] Weekly & monthly analytics visualizations
- [ ] AI predictions for next performance spike
